# About Me 
## My Interests
    I love to go axe throwing and hiking. Just went to Iceland recently and did both of these interests there. I am also an Illustration major and love to draw childrens books and fun drawings that are weird and wild. 
## Websites I Recommend
    -[Fairy Loot] (https://fairyloot.com/) One of my favorite websites out there, Fairy Loot is a book selling websie that has the greatest covers and edge drawings. 
    -[Youtube] (https://www.youtube.com/) Youtube is another favorite because of the learning you can do on this site. It also has so many shows and series you can watch as well.
